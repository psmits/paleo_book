Materials for **bookdown** short-course on analytical paleobiology.

The goal of this course is to help researchers in paleobiology, macroevolution, and macroecology better understand how to analyze their data, and how to clearly frame your scientific questions as staistical models.

This course covers Bayesian data analysis, regression models, graph theory/network analysis approaches to biogeography,


The material presented here is drawn from many sources. In particular, the introduction to Bayesian analysis is drawn heavily from [**Statistical Rethinking** by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Additional material on Bayesian data analysis and regression models in general are drawn from [**Bayesian Data Analysis 3** by Gelman et al.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), and [**Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models** by Gelman and Hill](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/data-analysis-using-regression-and-multilevelhierarchical-models/32A29531C7FD730C3A68951A17C9D983).
