# Varying-intercept(s)


## Objectives

- Introduce multilevel structures
- Introduce varying intercept models


```{r load_packages_08, message = F, results = 'hide'}

library(pacman)

p_load(tidyverse, here, janitor, purrr, viridis, brms, tidybayes, bayesplot,
       modelr, forcats, knitr, kableExtra)

theme_set(theme_bw())

```



ARM: with grouped data, a regression that includes indicators for groups is called a varying-intercept model because it can be interepreted as a model with a different intercept for each group.

$$
\begin{align}
y_{i} &= \text{Normal}(\alpha_{j[i]} + \beta x_{i}, \sigma)
\end{align}
